    "MC<sup>2</sup> contains a series of subprojects in the RISE Lab, all pertaining to <strong><u>M</u></strong>ultiparty <strong><u>C</u></strong>ollaboration and <strong><u>C</u></strong>oopetition. \n",
    "The particular project we'll be demonstrating today is Federated XGBoost, an extension of the <a href=\"https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">XGBoost</a> framework to the federated setting. \n",
    "\n",
    "The federated setting allows multiple parties train a model over their collective data with the help of a centralized *aggregator* server. Instead of sending their entire data to the aggregator, the parties only send summary statistics. This provides two benefits: (a) it conserves bandwidth, and (b) it limits the amount of information leaked to other parties in the federation.\n",

    "### Allstate Claim Prediction Dataset\n",
    "This dataset is used in the original XGBoost paper and is taken from a Kaggle competition.\n",
    "The goal of the competition is to predict insurance claim payments given multiple datapoints about the insured vehicle.\n",
    "Further information can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ClaimPredictionChallenge).\n",
    "We propose a usecase where some insurance company has multiple departments specializing in different makes of cars, and these departments are unable to share data between them.\n",
    "As such, a sample of the original Allstate Claim Prediction dataset is partitioned here into four groups, each of which represents one of these departments.\n",
    "In the following exercises, you will represent one such department, and your task will be to use the information provided to predict whether new insurance claims will be greater than 0, or equal to 0. (binary classification)\n",
    "You will then collaborate with the other departments, using our federated distributed XGBoost to collectively train a model without revealing all of your departments' data to one another."
