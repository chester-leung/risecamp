    "[Part 1](#Jupyter-Notebooks) provides a detailed explanation of Clipper, its architecture, and the Python API. You will explore these themes through the deployment of a `scikit-learn` model that classifies flowers based on their Sepal Length and Sepal Width.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Part 2](#Example-Application---Image-Classification) will walk you through a more realistic use case of Clipper by deploying a PyTorch image, as well as a custom image running a Darknet YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. The PyTorch image is a SqueezeNet model that will allow you to classify images of your choosing. The Darknet YOLO (You Only Look Once) model can be used to draw bounding boxes and labels in images. This will be a great opportunity to observe the Clipper API at work, as well as a chance to play around with some fun models.\n",

    "<p>The Clipper Admin tool is distributed through Pip. You can install it with <code>pip install clipper_admin</code>, but it has already been installed in this notebook for you.</p>\n",
    "<p>Clipper uses Docker containers as its deployment mechanism. A running Clipper cluster consists of a collection of Docker containers communicating with each other over the network. As you issue commands against Clipper, you are communicating with these containers as well as creating new ones or destroying existing ones. As you explore the Clipper API throughout this exercise, we will illustrate how each command effects the cluster state.</p>\n",
    "<p>The main API for interacting with Clipper is exposed via a <a href=\"http://docs.clipper.ai/en/develop/#clipper-connection\" target=\"_blank\"><code>ClipperConnection</code></a> object. This is your handle to a Clipper cluster (this collection of Docker containers). It can be used to start, stop, inspect, and modify the cluster.</p>\n",
    "<p>In order to create a <code>ClipperConnection</code> object, you must provide it with a <a href=\"http://docs.clipper.ai/en/develop/#container-managers\" target=\"_blank\"><code>ContainerManager</code></a> object. While Docker is becoming an increasingly standard mechanism for deploying applications, there are many different tools for managing a Docker cluster. These tools broadly fall into the category of <em>Container Orchestration frameworks</em>. Some popular examples are <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Kubernetes</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/\" target=\"_blank\">Docker Swarm</a>, and <a href=\"https://dcos.io/\" target=\"_blank\">DC/OS</a>. One of the reasons we run Clipper in Docker containers is to make the system as general as possible and support many different deployment scenarios. Within the Clipper Admin, we abstract away all of the Docker container-specific commands behind the <code>ContainerManager</code> interface. The <code>ClipperConnection</code> object makes Clipper-specific decisions about how to issue commands, and then makes any changes to the Docker configuration (for example, to launch a container for a newly deployed model) through the <code>ContainerManager</code>. To support different container orchestration frameworks that manage Docker containers in different ways, we create different implementations of the <code>ContainerManager</code> interface.</p>\n",
    "<p>Clipper currently provides two <code>ContainerManager</code> implementations: the <code>DockerContainerManager</code> and the <code>KubernetesContainerManager</code>. In this exercise, you will be using the <code>DockerContainerManager</code>, which runs Clipper directly on your local Docker instance. This <code>ContainerManager</code> is particularly useful for trying out Clipper without needing to set up an enterprise-grade container orchestration framework. The <code>DockerContainerManager</code> is not recommended for production use cases.</p>\n",

The prediction interface that models must implement is very simple, consisting of a single function. And the use of Docker makes it easy to include all of a model's dependencies in a self-contained environment.

If your model can be deployed with one of these deployers, you no longer need to write a model container, create a Docker image, or even figure out how to save a model. Instead, you provide your trained model directly to the model deployer function within your Python process. The model deployer takes care of saving the model and building a Docker image that is compatible with your model type.</p>\n",
    "<p>Clipper provides model deployers for many common ML packages including PySpark, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc. In addition, Clipper provides a Python model deployer that can deploy arbitrary Python functions as long as they can be pickled. Finally, if none of these fit your needs, you can always write a custom model container that can execute arbitrary code.</p>\n",
    "<p>To keep the base images small, Clipper model containers install only the required dependencies to ensure that a basic model will run. However, if your model requires custom Python packages installed, you can specify these additional packages to the model deployer and it will automatically use Pip to install them inside your model's Docker container.

Because of this, Clipper tries to provide multiple inputs at once to a deployed model. Therefore, models deployed to Clipper must have a function interface that takes a list of inputs as an argument and returns a list of predictions as strings. Returning predictions as strings provides a lot of flexibility over what your models can return. Commonly, models in Clipper will return either a single number (such as a label or score) or JSON containing a richer representation of the model output (for example, by including confidence estimates of predicted labels).</p></details>"

You will still be able to observe some batching, however, thanks to Clipper's batching exploration algorithm. Clipper will occasionally inject additional queries into the system (when it is underloaded) to explore the throughput-latency tradeoff for each model. This exploration algorithm estimates a function that predicts query latency based on the batch size, thereby enabling Clipper to choose the largest batch size (and therefore the highest throughput) that is still capable of returning within the deadline imposed by the latency SLO. Clipper estimates a different function for each model container, allowing the system to adapt to different model characteristics and varying resource loads.</p>\n",
